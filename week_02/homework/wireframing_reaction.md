The article on wireframing brought a few particular things to my attention. First, it was interesting to read just how much needs to be considered when designing a website, and how sketching it out/wireframing it is much better than jumping straight into developing on a computer. It allows you to visualise the website and interactivity and thus flesh out any issues before they might occur. It was also interesting to read about how a developer can create different types of wireframes depending on what a customer wants. For example, a high-fidelity wireframe would be made for customers who want to see their website as close to reality as possible, whereas a low-fidelity wireframe would be made for those who just want to know where the elemenets will be laid out on the screen and how this will effect interactivity.
