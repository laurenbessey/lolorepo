## Ingredients
### Butter Sponge
- 125g unsalted butter (softened)
- 1 cup caster sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 eggs (room temperature)
- 1 3/4 cups flour (plain, sifted)
- 3.5 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup milk (low or full fat)
### Icing
- 4 cups icing sugar (sifted)
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 150ml boiling water
### Coating
- 3-4 cups desiccated coconut
## Instructions
### Butter Sponge
1. Preheat oven to 180C (or fan forced 160C)
2. Sift flour and baking powder together
3. Grease a 20cm x 30cm cake pan. Line with baking paper, leaving an overhang on all sides.
4. Beat butter, sugar and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium high speed until light and fluffy - about 1.5 to 2 minutes.
5. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition so the batter is smooth, not curdled.
6. Add half the flour and gently fold to combine, then stir in half the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25 minutes until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
8. Stand for 5 minutes then use the overhang baking paper to lift the cake out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
### Prepare Cake to Coat
1. Cut cake into 15 squares (5x3), or 18 rectangles. Freeze for 1 to 1.5 hours.
### Icing
1. Combine the icing ingredients in a heat proof bowl and mix until smooth. Should be a syrup consistency, but not watery.
### Coating
1. Place coconut in a shallow bowl or pan with a largish surface area.
2. Place a piece of cake in the icing and roll to coat using 2 forks. Transfer it into the coconut and quickly roll to coat all over in coconut. Transfer to tray.
3. Repeat with remaining sponges.
4. Stand for 1 to 2 hours, or until set. Then serve with tea and coffee.
## Enjoy!
