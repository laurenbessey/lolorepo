            <li>1 3/4 cups flour (plain, sifted)</li>
            <li>3.5 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk (low or full fat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Icing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups icing sugar (sifted)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>150ml boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Coating</h4>

            <li>3-4 cups desiccated coconut</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Butter Sponge</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat over to 180C (or fan forced 160C).</li>
            <li>Sift flour and baking powder together.</li>
            <li>Grease a 20cm x 30cm cake pan. Line with baking paper, leaving an overhang on all sides.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, sugar and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium high speed until light and fluffy - about 1.5 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition so the batter is smooth, not curdled.</li>
            <li>Add half the flour and gently fold to combine, then stir in half the milk. Repeat with remaining flour and milk.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25 minutes until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Stand for 5 minutes then use the overhang baking paper to lift the cake out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Prepare Cake to Coat</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut cake into 15 squares (5x3), or 18 rectangles. Freeze for 1 to 1.5 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Icing</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the icing ingredients in a heat proof bowl and mix until smooth. Should be a syrup consistency, but not watery.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Coating</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place coconut in a shallow bowl or pan with a largish surface area.</li>
            <li>Place a piece of cake in the icing and roll to coat using 2 forks. Transfer it into the coconut and quickly roll to coat all over in coconut. Trasfer to tray.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining sponges.</li>
            <li>Stand for 1 to 2 hours, or until set. Then serve with tea and coffee.</li>
        </ol>
